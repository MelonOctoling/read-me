# read-me
Hello!!! You can call me Melon, Mel, Melanie, Fartballs or **Cadet Fartballs McWomanfan27**. Yes, those are all viable aliases of mine. 
You may barely know me if you see me on ponytown, I avoid talking to players I don't know!

If you're reading this *before* interacting with me, and want to, be wary:
- **If I'm making a lot of spelling mistakes**, in almost every single word, I'm probably tired or stressed/distressed. Can also happen when I'm excited. It means I'm typing too fast for me to actually use proper words, often due to previously listed reasons.
- **"Not very responsive" / "Afk" / "Offtab" names** don't necessarily mean I'm afk or offtab, and often I'm just upset and avoiding contact with some. You can still interact, but I'll probably be rude or silent.
- **"Int/w2i" names** are a bit rare!! lots of the time i dont wanna interact with randoms outside of rps and other parties, so PLEASE interact!! w2i might make me slow to respond!!
- **Don't be a weirdo....** I swear this is common sense but I guess internet trolls aren't exactly the smartest people ever. BUT!!! I am an instigator and love fighting with people sooo...
- **"IWEC / IWC" names** indicate that I'm going through something and that I'm aware that I might lash out. If youre wondering; IWC = Interact With Caution. IWEC = Interact With Extreme Caution. This can extend to people I know/care about and I might yell at my  friends.
- **Covering me, cuddling me, sitting on a bench while I'm on it with a friend** will annoy me. I'm prone to escalating stuff unless im already too exhausted to.
- **If I'm playing splatoon, it will be in my name!** You're free to ask to join and I'll open a pool if I'm not in one already :) Just please don't squidparty the entire time in every match, I get sick of it quickly. I'm almost always cosplaying unless I'm in Tower Control!
- **I get more nervous when I see others in the same cosplay as me, or dressed as one of my copinglinks** (it's a fear that i'm misrepresenting the character, yaknow-- especially if ur also a kin of that char-- dw about it!!!)
- **DNI / DNIUC / DNIUF names** are literal. I don't want you talking to me. If you're wondering: DNI = Do Not interact. -UC = Unless Close. -UF = Unless Friend. (All my online siblings are close. Others on my friends list are just friends and not close. Please keep this in mind if I friend you.)

  Now that that's settled, you're welcome to try talking to me! Or if you decide not to, have a good day!
