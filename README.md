# read-me
Hello!!! You can call me Melon, Mel, Melanie, Fartballs or **Cadet Fartballs McWomanfan27**. Yes, those are all viable aliases of mine. 
You may barely know me if you see me on ponytown, I avoid talking to players I don't know!
If you see me with my brother, you can interact, but both of us are awkward so I wouldn't reccommend it.

If you're reading this *before* interacting with me, and want to, be wary:
- If I'm making a lot of spelling mistakes, in almost every single word, I'm probably tired or stressed/distressed. Can also happen when I'm excited. It means I'm typing too fast for me to actually use proper words, often due to previously listed reasons.
- **"Not very responsive" / "Afk" / "Offtab" names** don't necessarily mean I'm afk or offtab, and often I'm just upset and avoiding contact with some. You can still interact, but I'll probably be rude or silent.
- **"IWEC / IWC" names indicate that I'm going through something and that I'm aware that I might lash out. If youre wondering; IWC = Interact With Caution. IWEC = Interact With Extreme Caution. This can extend to people I know/care about and I might yell at my brother or friends.
- **Covering me, cuddling me, sitting on a bench while I'm on it with my brother** will annoy me. I can and will either trash talk you in whispers with someone else or out of whispers. Can escalate from there.
- **If I'm playing splatoon, it will be in my name!** You're free to ask to join and I'll open a pool if I'm not in one already :) Just please don't squidparty the entire time in every match, I get sick of it quickly. I'm almost always cosplaying unless I'm in Tower Control!
- **I get more nervous when I see others in the same cosplay as me, or dressed as one of my copinglinks** (e.g I'm dressed as my Full Moon Glasses copinglink skin, and someone else is cosplaying her too, I'll probably be watching them a lot from behind my screen.)
- **DNI / DNIUC / DNIUF names** are literal. I don't want you talking to me. If you're wondering: DNI = Do Not interact. -UC = Unless Close. -UF = Unless Friend. (My brother, Bingus, Monika, Guard and Tikialia are close to me. Others on my friends list are just friends and not close. Please keep this in mind.)
- I have a carrd on here for a reason, you can go look at it if you want! I have a list of my comfs and cls on there, just scroll to the bottom of my about me page :)

  Now that that's settled, you're welcome to try talking to me! Or if you decide not to, have a good day!
